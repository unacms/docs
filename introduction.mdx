## What is UNA Platform and why use it?

UNA Platform is an "open platform" created to streamline deployment, support and updates of the UNA Framework and UNA Apps. 
It is a set of tools and services that allow developers to build, launch and manage UNA-powered social networks and community apps.

Modern social networks require a lot of moving parts to work together - database, backend server, web server, CDN, email server, media server, 
front-end code, mobile apps, etc. With UNA Platform we automate the deployment and management of all these components, so that developers can 
focus on building their apps. Additionally, UNA Platform hosts the community of the network oeprators; provides a marketplace for apps, templates and services; 
offers documentation for UNA Framework and UNA Apps; and integrates UNA Professional Services.

As an **open network** UNA Platform does not force a vendor lock-in. Developers can use UNA Framework on their own insfrastructure, can choose to 
update UNA Apps manually or create their own marketplace, and can use any of the UNA Professional Services providers. UNA Platform makes it easier to 
start and manage UNA-powered networks, but it does not limit the options for developers.
