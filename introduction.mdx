## What is UNA Platform?

UNA Platform is an "open platform" created to streamline deployment, support and updates of the UNA Framework and UNA Apps. 
It is a set of tools and services that allow developers to build, launch and manage UNA-powered social networks and community apps.

Modern social networks require a lot of moving parts to work together - database, backend server, web server, CDN, email server, media server, 
front-end code, mobile apps, etc. With UNA Platform we automate the deployment and management of all these components, so that developers can 
focus on building their apps. Additionally, UNA Platform hosts the community of the network oeprators; provides a marketplace for apps, templates and services; 
offers documentation for UNA Framework and UNA Apps; and integrates UNA Professional Services.
