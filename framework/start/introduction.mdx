## What is UNA Framework and why use it?

The name UNA stands for Universal Networking Application. UNA-powered online communities can serve as social networks, business collaboration hubs, or any type of multi-user system with various memberships, roles, content types, and permissions defining the rules of community operation.

In addition to traditional web applications, UNA can be used as a headless CMS providing API endpoints for custom integrations and custom client apps.

Although UNA can be used as a conventional CMS or blogging platform with a focus on content publishing, its full potential is realized in networking. This includes social networking, business networking, or even networking with Internet-connected devices.


## How does UNA Framework work?

As the primary purpose of UNA is to power a website, it needs to be installed on a web-hosting server like most other web applications. UNA can be used for both public and private sites.

UNA can be installed as a monolithic application or as a set of microservices. The monolithic installation is the most common and recommended approach. It is easier to install, maintain, and upgrade. The microservices approach is more complex and requires a higher level of technical expertise. It is used for large-scale deployments with high traffic and complex requirements.

UNA has its own storage engine, template engine, media transcoding, and a no-code configuration system GUI, called UNA Studio.

Once installed on a hosting server, UNA creates a fully operational website ready for customization. Over time, you can activate various UNA Apps, install new ones, update them, and adjust site settings to meet your specific requirements.

One of the key advantages of choosing UNA over other solutions is the administration and ownership rights provided by UNA. The operator retains full control over the site, database, hosting server, collected data, and user profiles. There are no restrictions on the number of members or the amount of content the site can host, allowing developers and development agencies the flexibility they need to build robust online communities.
